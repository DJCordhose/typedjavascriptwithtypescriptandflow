# Typed JavaScript with TypeScript and Flow

JavaScript is the natural choice when developing for the browser. For larger projects, however,
there may be issues concerning type safety and refactoring.

TypeScript and Flow are two approaches to compensate for that shortcoming.

Flow is a static type checker that has been developed and used by Facebook to find errors in
JavaScript and more specifically React code.

TypeScript is an extension to JavaScript that compiles back to ES5 or ES6.
It is actively developed by Microsoft and used as primary language for Google's Angular 2 framework.
